# Cycle Detection

The aim is to find cycles in a directed graph G(V, E). This can be help in many situations such as avoiding cycles and deadlocks in operating systems. In order to implement the cycle detection program, we'll be using depth first search algorithm ([DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search#:~:text=Depth%2Dfirst%20search%20(DFS),along%20each%20branch%20before%20backtracking.)).
